Added URP compatibility from 2021.3 and later.


When importing the pack in a URP project, open the "URP_Install_Toon Fantasy Nature" file from the project hierarchy.
This will replace the custom toon shaders with URP compatible custom toon shaders.


Renderer settings:
Please check the "Depth Texture" and "Opaque Texture" in the renderer settings.
